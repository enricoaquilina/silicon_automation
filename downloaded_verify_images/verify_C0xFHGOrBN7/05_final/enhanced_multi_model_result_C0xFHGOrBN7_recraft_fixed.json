The yellow accents add a touch of vibrancy and contrast to the overall composition. The artistic style is a blend of futuristic and abstract, creating a visually striking and thought-provoking image.\n\nTo create a similar artwork, one could start by sketching the basic outline of the woman's face and the interconnected lines. Then, use digital art software or a graphics tablet to fill in the lines and create the mesh-like pattern. Finally, add the yellow accents and adjust the color balance to achieve the desired black and yellow color scheme. The background can be kept simple, focusing on the woman's face and the intricate network of lines.
